## üåü Features

### üß† Core Functionalities

-   **Domain Resolution**  
    Resolves the target domain to its IP address(es).

-   **Subdomain Enumeration**  
    Discovers subdomains using common wordlist brute-forcing.

-   **Port Scanning (Optional)**  
    Uses `nmap` to identify open TCP/UDP ports.

-   **Service & Version Detection**  
    Identifies services running on open ports along with version details (requires port scan).

-   **OS Detection**  
    Performs operating system fingerprinting using `nmap` (requires port scan).

-   **Web Technology Detection**  
    Detects CMS, frameworks, libraries, and analytics tools used by the target and its subdomains.

-   **Directory Brute-Forcing**  
    Searches for common web directories using a wordlist (301 redirects excluded by default).

-   **Cloud Storage Check**  
    Checks for publicly accessible AWS S3 and Google Cloud buckets based on naming conventions.

-   **TFTP Server Check**  
    Identifies potential TFTP servers using UDP scan results (requires port scan with UDP enabled).

-   **Concurrent Scanning**  
    Multi-threaded scanning for faster and efficient reconnaissance.

-   **Rich Console Output**  
    Utilizes the `rich` Python library for beautifully formatted console output.

-   **File Reporting**  
    Saves results in `.txt` or `.json` formats for later reference.
